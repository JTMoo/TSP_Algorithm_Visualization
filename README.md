# Traveling Salesman Problem
The traveling salesman problem (TSP) describes a problem where a salesman travels to different towns but wants to know the shortest route to do this.
For only a few towns, this can be answered simply and with a perfect answer.
With increased amount of towns, this becomes more complex and time expensive to compute. 
The time complexity for the runtime depends on the algorithm used to compute the solution.

# Visualization
This project tries to visualize and demonstrate the TSP and enables writing and visualizing different algorithms.
